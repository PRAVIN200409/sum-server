# 🧮 Addition Server Project

## 📖 Overview

The Addition Server project is a web-based application that is likely designed to perform arithmetic operations or serve a related purpose. It is divided into two main parts:

- **Backend (`backend/`)**: Contains the server-side code, including the main server configuration and dependencies.
- **Frontend (`sum-server/`)**: Contains the frontend files, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with configuration files for build tools like Vite and Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 Getting Started
